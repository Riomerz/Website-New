<h3>USE OF THE SERVICES</h3>
Welcome to Knit. Please continue reading to learn about the rules and restrictions that govern use of the knitapp.co.in website and all other websites affiliated with Company, and any other linked pages, features, or content (collectively, the "Website") and the Knit mobile application (on Android) and any other products, services and applications offered from time to time by Company (collectively, with the Website, the "Services"). The term "Services" will include, without limitation, any service Company performs for you and the content offered by Company on the Website or any application.
<h3>CHANGE TO THESE TERMS</h3>
We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so this Agreement may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Website or in our applications, or by sending you a notice via email. You will be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your use of the Services or the Website following such notification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.
You represent and warrant to Company that: (i) you are an individual (i.e., not a corporation) and you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent's permission to use the Services, and your parent has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf); (ii) all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; (iii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (iv) if you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of an institution, company or other legal entity, you have the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of that institution, company or legal entity.

This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.
<h3>USE BY CHILDREN</h3>
Because some of our users may be interested in it, we have included some information below related to the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA"). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent, with limited exceptions, before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13, except for that child's name, email address, and child's parent's email address, which is the limited amount of personally identifiable information we are allowed to collect in order to provide notice to parents regarding the fact that we may contact their child multiple times for the purpose of providing the service that their teacher has signed up for. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13, except for that child's name, email address, and child's parent's email address, without parental consent being obtained from his or her parent or guardian, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at knit@trumplab.com.

<h3>CHANGE TO THE SERVICES</h3>
We're always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical.
<h3>FEES AND PAYMENT</h3>
Access to and use of the Services is free, but in the future, we may offer new or additional special features which Company may charge for.

If you continue to use those Services following such notification, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.
<h3>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h3>
The Services may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Company. When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. Company encourages you to be aware when you leave the Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website that you visit.

In addition, Company will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site. By using the Services, you expressly relieve and hold harmless Company from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website. Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Company will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Company is under no obligation to become involved.

If you are a California resident, you will and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
<h3>TERMINATION</h3>
This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your use of the Services or your account at any time by contacting us at knit@trumplab.com . Company may suspend or terminate your access to the Services, Website or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), and without warning or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services, access the Website, and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company will not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sub licensable by you except with Company's prior written consent. Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. This Agreement and any subsequent versions of this Agreement posted to the Website and/or Services will be deemed a writing signed by both parties. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any way whatsoever.
