What is Board of Teachers?

	Board of Teachers (BoT) consists smart, passionate, and inspiring educators who are trying to connect their communities using Knit. Our team arms them with the tools they need to save teacher’s time, engage parents, and better serve students in their school community and beyond.


Why does Knit need BoT?

	Fundamental principle we had in mind when we founded Knit was talking to teachers about their communication obstacles and how we can help solve them. We believe the future of Knit is reliant on continuing to work hand in hand with teachers in the same way we got our start. That is the basic reason we created the Board of Teachers (BoT). We’re not experts on classroom needs, teachers are. Today, no product decisions are made, tested, or released, without the input of these teachers.
