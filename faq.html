                            Messaging is one-way so teachers share the most important class information, reminders and updates, but there is no chance of unfair or inappropriate back-and-forth communication between student and teacher.</p>

2) Via SMS (text): To sign up for a teacher's messages, you just need the class code. So, if the class code were "TS12345" and you were “Mr. XYZ”, then you would send the text message:<br></br>
subscribe TS12345 Mr. XYZ

TEXT:
If you have successfully subscribed to a class by text (i.e. the code is correct and the teacher's name is accurate), then it's possible the teacher has not sent any messages yet. As soon as he/she does, you should receive them.  
You can text &#39; help &#39; to the Knit support number (+91-9619834032/+91-9967341714) and if you get a reply, you're all set! If not, troubleshoot HERE.<br></br>
             APP:
             If your app shows "No Messages” or you only see last year&#39;s messages, the teacher probably has not sent a message yet. Check your Notifications to ensure Push, SMS or Email is enabled.

The best way to solve this duplicate account issue is to choose one account to be your sole Knit account and use only this new account when you create new classes. You can then delete your second account.<br></br>

If you have subscribers in both accounts you have two options.
1. Continue using both accounts to message your current subscribers<br>
                                                                 Or<br>
2. Choose which account you would like to be your primary account. Take note of all the classes and class codes in your second (non-primary) account. Delete your second (non-primary) account. Login to your primary account and recreate those classes with the same class name and class code. You will now have to have your subscribers resubscribe to the same class code.</p>

The app is optional but does provide some additional features and a richer environment for receiving messages.<br>
Step 1: Download the app <br>
Step 2: Choose "Create an Account"<br>
Step 3: Enter your name, email address, and a password<br>
(If we recognize your email address from joining a class previously, click the verification link that we email you. Return to the app and "Log in.")

If you have created an account in the Knit app, you can click on "Settings" and update your name very quickly.
If you do not have an account but you have subscribed via text or email, just email us the phone number or email that you used to join, along with the first and last name that you prefer!<br>
