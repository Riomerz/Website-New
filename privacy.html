    <h3>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Company collects and uses information from its users who access or use the Services, including Company's treatment of
    personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of any Personal Information that
    Company's business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website or service using a Company application.
    This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not
    employ or manage.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES COMPANY DISPLAY OR COLLECT?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various
    channels as permitted by the functionality of the Services. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and,
    in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Services. In most cases, we retain such information to provide the
    Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior
    version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the
    following types of information from our users.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US:</h3>
</p>
<p>
    We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to
    us in any other way. This information may include Personal Information such as your name, phone number, email address, photograph, and, in certain
    circumstances, your school affiliation, which is used to provide notifications to users via the Services from a teacher, school, and/or district
    ("Notifications"), and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. We only collect a child's name, email address, and that child's
    parent's email address, described above, from children under 13 to provide notice to parents regarding the service. You may choose not to provide us with
    certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes
    as providing the Services, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating
    with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and
    accessing features to edit your classes and/or account information.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:</h3>
</p>
<p>
    We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Services or our services. Company automatically receives and records
    information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Company cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the
    details of your activity on the Services. This information is not Personal Information. Certain information that is collected automatically such as device
    ID and phone number will be treated as Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
    Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to
    TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and
    not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Services or
    services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may
    provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners
    also understand how often people use our partners' services and the Services to help provide you with an optimal online experience.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mobile Application:</strong>
    When users download and use our mobile application, we automatically collect IP address, device ID, device type, user agent browser, what OS they are
    running, whether or not you signed up on the web, and phone number. If a user is under 13 and using our Student Application we do not collect the device ID
    or IP address, we will only collect the device type and OS they are running.
</p>
<p>
    We collect geo-location information from teachers when they download and use our mobile application. The purpose for doing so is to provide teachers a
    generic phone number in their area code so that we are able to provide them with one in their area. If the teachers no longer wish to have their location
information collected or used they may turn these features off within the settings of their phone or contact us at  <a href="mailto:knit@trumplab.com"><u>knit@trumplab.com</u></a>. We do not ask you for, access or automatically track any location-based information
    from students' or parents' mobile devices at any time.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGE COMMUNICATIONS:</h3>
</p>
<p>
    If you provide us your email address or phone number, we may send you email or text message communications. By maintaining a Company account and/or failing
    to opt out of the receipt of information hereunder, you acknowledge that you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile communications
    device, and that the receipt of such messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service
    plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates,
    charges, fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program.
    Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications you may
opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication or by emailing us at  <a href="mailto:knit@trumplab.com"><u>knit@trumplab.com</u></a>. We only send these types of communications to children under 13 with verifiable
    parental consent. If we do not obtain such consent then we will not collect or use this type of information.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
</p>
<p>
    We send push notifications to users who are students when their teacher has posted something new within the class to which they belong. If you no longer
    with to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level. If you are a parent of a child who is under 13, you always have the choice
    to no longer allow your child to receive such communications by contacting us at <a href="mailto:knit@trumplab.com"><u>knit@trumplab.com</u></a>. Any
    user may email us at <a href="mailto:knit@trumplab.com"><u>knit@trumplab.com</u></a> if such user no longer wishes to receive communications from the
    Services.

    sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We h3ly recommend that you leave

    behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
    Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using
    the Services and after you leave our Services.
</p>
<p>

    manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
    cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are
    embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to
    our customers' personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>MOBILE ANALYTICS</h3>
</p>
<p>
    We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality and performance of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may

    the application was downloaded from.
